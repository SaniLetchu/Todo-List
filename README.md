# Todo-List
Project: Todo List from Odin Project

A working todo list site
You can create To-do tasks, projects that are formed by To-do tasks and notes.

You can view all your To-do tasks differently:

Home tab: Contains all the To-do tasks.
Completed tab: Contains all the completed To-do tasks.
Overdue tab: Contains all the overdue To-do tasks.
Today tab: Contains To-do tasks that are due today and have not been completed.
Week tab: Contains To-do tasks that are due in a week and have not been completed.
Project tabs: Contains all the To-do tasks assigned to that project.
Note tabs: Contains information about a note.

You can assign task to be completed by checking the checkbox. You can view details about the tasks, edit the task or delete it.

Projects can be deleted if they don't contain any tasks.

Notes can be edited whenever and deleted whenever.

During this project I practiced using date-fns library and Web Storage API. I also practiced more DOM manipulation and OOP-principles.

Negatives:
Poor planning led to messy code.
